# Withdrawal Proof - Example Prover Inputs
#
# These are example values for generating a test proof.
# In production, these would be computed by the client SDK.
#
# Note: Field values are represented as decimal strings.
# The state_root, nullifier, and withdrawal_commitment must be
# computed from the private inputs using Poseidon hashing.

# --- Public Inputs ---

# Merkle root of the vesting state tree (computed from leaf + path)
# This value must be computed by walking up the tree from position_leaf
# using the vesting_path siblings. For this example with a leaf derived
# from identity_commitment(42) + amount(1000) and all-zero path,
# the root is computed iteratively.
state_root = "0"

# Current epoch identifier
epoch_id = 1

# Nullifier = Poseidon(identity_secret, epoch_id)
# Prevents double-withdrawal within the same epoch
nullifier = "0"

# Withdrawal commitment = Poseidon(claimed_amount)
# Hides the actual amount being withdrawn
withdrawal_commitment = "0"

# --- Private Inputs ---

# Total vesting amount for this position (in token smallest unit)
vesting_amount = 1000

# Secret key material - only known to the beneficiary
identity_secret = "42"

# Merkle proof path - 32 sibling hashes from leaf to root
# All zeros represents a position at index 0 in an empty tree
vesting_path = [
