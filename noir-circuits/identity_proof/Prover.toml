# Identity Proof - Example Prover Inputs
#
# These are example values for generating a test proof.
# In production, these would be derived from the employee's
# stealth key material and the on-chain position data.
#
# The position_commitment must equal:
#   Poseidon(identity_commitment, encrypted_amount, start_time, cliff, duration)
# where identity_commitment = Poseidon(identity_preimage)

# --- Public Input ---

# The on-chain position commitment (stored in Light Protocol compressed account)
# This value must be computed from the private inputs below.
# position_commitment = Poseidon(Poseidon(identity_preimage), position_data[0..3])
position_commitment = "0"

# --- Private Inputs ---

# Secret identity value - only known to the beneficiary
# This is derived from the employee's stealth key material
identity_preimage = "77"

# Position data fields:
# [0] encrypted_amount - The encrypted vesting amount (ciphertext)
# [1] start_time       - Unix timestamp when vesting begins
# [2] cliff            - Cliff period in seconds (e.g., 2592000 = 30 days)
# [3] duration         - Total vesting duration in seconds (e.g., 31536000 = 1 year)
position_data = ["50000", "1700000000", "2592000", "31536000"]
