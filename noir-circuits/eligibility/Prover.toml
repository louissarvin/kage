# Eligibility Proof - Example Prover Inputs
#
# These are example values for generating a test proof.
# In production, these would be derived from the employee's
# stealth key material and the on-chain position data.
#
# Computation:
#   beneficiary_commitment = Poseidon(identity_secret)
#   nullifier = Poseidon(identity_secret, position_id)
#   position_commitment = Poseidon(beneficiary_commitment, vesting_amount)

# --- Private Inputs ---

# Secret key material - only known to the beneficiary
identity_secret = "12345"

# Total vesting amount (used for position binding verification)
vesting_amount = 50000

# --- Public Inputs ---

# Poseidon(identity_secret) - the on-chain identity commitment
beneficiary_commitment = "0"

# Poseidon(identity_secret, position_id) - prevents double-claims
nullifier = "0"

# Identifies which vesting position this proof is for
position_id = "1"

# Poseidon(beneficiary_commitment, vesting_amount) - binds identity to position
position_commitment = "0"
